  The Pigweed docs (powered by Sphinx) are using Doxygen and Breathe to
  single-source their API reference documenation. Last night I was having
  trouble getting a plaintext diagram to render correctly. This is how I
  fixed it.

<p>{frontmatter.description}</p>

I am taking a [small CLs] approach to converting the Pigweed docs to use Doxygen.
I am converting one section/function at a time. Last night I was trying to convert
this section:

```
// The "Block" type is intended to be a building block component for
// allocators. In the this design, there is an explicit pointer to next and
// prev from the block header; the size is not encoded. The below diagram shows
// what this would look like for two blocks.
//
//   .------+---------------------------------.-----------------------------
//   |            Block A (first)             |       Block B (second)
//
//   +------+------+--------------------------+------+------+---------------
//   | Next | Prev |   usable space           | Next | Prev | usable space..
//   +------+------+--------------------------+------+--+---+---------------
//   ^  |                                     ^         |
//   |  '-------------------------------------'         |
//   |                                                  |
//   '----------- Block B's prev points to Block A -----'
//
// One use for these blocks is to use them as allocations, where each block
// represents an allocation handed out by malloc(). These blocks could also be
// used as part of a slab or buddy allocator.
//
// Each block also contains flags for whether it is the last block (i.e. whether
// the "next" pointer points to a valid block, or just denotes the end of this
// block), and whether the block is in use. These are encoded into the last two
// bits of the "next" pointer, as follows:
//
//  .-----------------------------------------------------------------------.
//  |                            Block                                      |
//  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
//  |              Next            | Prev |         usable space            |
//  +----------------+------+------+      +                                 |
//  |   Ptr[N..2]    | Last | Used |      |                                 |
//  +----------------+------+------+------+---------------------------------+
//  ^
//  |
//  '----------- Next() = Next & ~0x3 --------------------------------->
//
// The first block in a chain is denoted by a nullptr "prev" field, and the last
// block is denoted by the "Last" bit being set.
//
// Note, This block class requires that the given block is aligned to a
// alignof(Block*) boundary. Because of this alignment requirement, each
// returned block will also be aligned to a alignof(Block*) boundary, and the
// size will always be rounded up to a multiple of alignof(Block*).
//
// This class must be constructed using the static Init call.
```

The full text isn't relevant here so from now on let's just represent the
source code like this:

```
// The "Block" type is intended to ...
//
//   .------+---------------------------------.-----------------------------
//   |            Block A (first)             |       Block B (second)
//
//   +------+------+--------------------------+------+------+---------------
//   | Next | Prev |   usable space           | Next | Prev | usable space..
//   +------+------+--------------------------+------+--+---+---------------
//   ^  |                                     ^         |
//   |  '-------------------------------------'         |
//   |                                                  |
//   '----------- Block B's prev points to Block A -----'
//
// One use for these blocks is ...
//
// Each block also contains flags for ...
//
//  .-----------------------------------------------------------------------.
//  |                            Block                                      |
//  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
//  |              Next            | Prev |         usable space            |
//  +----------------+------+------+      +                                 |
//  |   Ptr[N..2]    | Last | Used |      |                                 |
//  +----------------+------+------+------+---------------------------------+
//  ^
//  |
//  '----------- Next() = Next & ~0x3 --------------------------------->
//
// The first block in a chain is ...
//
// Note, This block class requires ...
//
// This class must be ...
```

Arguably, this info should be in a concepts doc, not the reference, but long story
short I have thought it through and we are better off keeping it in the reference.

Let's convert this to the triple slash syntax so that Doxygen picks it up:

```
/// The "Block" type is intended to ...
///
///   .------+---------------------------------.-----------------------------
///   |            Block A (first)             |       Block B (second)
///
///   +------+------+--------------------------+------+------+---------------
///   | Next | Prev |   usable space           | Next | Prev | usable space..
///   +------+------+--------------------------+------+--+---+---------------
///   ^  |                                     ^         |
///   |  '-------------------------------------'         |
///   |                                                  |
///   '----------- Block B's prev points to Block A -----'
///
/// One use for these blocks is ...
///
/// Each block also contains flags for ...
///
///  .-----------------------------------------------------------------------.
///  |                            Block                                      |
///  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
///  |              Next            | Prev |         usable space            |
///  +----------------+------+------+      +                                 |
///  |   Ptr[N..2]    | Last | Used |      |                                 |
///  +----------------+------+------+------+---------------------------------+
///  ^
///  |
///  '----------- Next() = Next & ~0x3 --------------------------------->
///
/// The first block in a chain is ...
///
/// Note, This block class requires ...
///
/// This class must be ...
```

How does that look?

<img src="/verbatim-wrangling-1.png"
     alt="The rendered page after the first attempt. The visual representation
          of the text diagram is completely wrong."/>

Absolutely terrible, that's how. But that's OK. I expected that. Wrapping the diagrams
in Doxygen's [verbatim] command should do the trick...

```
/// The "Block" type is intended to ...
///
/// @verbatim
///   .------+---------------------------------.-----------------------------
///   |            Block A (first)             |       Block B (second)
///
///   +------+------+--------------------------+------+------+---------------
///   | Next | Prev |   usable space           | Next | Prev | usable space..
///   +------+------+--------------------------+------+--+---+---------------
///   ^  |                                     ^         |
///   |  '-------------------------------------'         |
///   |                                                  |
///   '----------- Block B's prev points to Block A -----'
/// @endverbatim
///
/// One use for these blocks is ...
///
/// Each block also contains flags for ...
///
/// @verbatim
///  .-----------------------------------------------------------------------.
///  |                            Block                                      |
///  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
///  |              Next            | Prev |         usable space            |
///  +----------------+------+------+      +                                 |
///  |   Ptr[N..2]    | Last | Used |      |                                 |
///  +----------------+------+------+------+---------------------------------+
///  ^
///  |
///  '----------- Next() = Next & ~0x3 --------------------------------->
/// @endverbatim
///
/// The first block in a chain is ...
///
/// Note, This block class requires ...
///
/// This class must be ...
```

Let's check how it looks...

<img src="/verbatim-wrangling-2.png"
     alt="The rendered page after the second attempt. The first diagram is
          mostly rendering correctly but the rest of the text and the second diagram
          is still completely wrong."/>

Uh-oh. I was expecting that to work. This might get hairy.

The [Handling Leading Slashes] section in the Breathe docs seems to be relevant
to my problem. Let's try Breathe's solution:

```
/// The "Block" type is intended to ...
///
/// @verbatim embed:rst:leading-slashes
///   .------+---------------------------------.-----------------------------
///   |            Block A (first)             |       Block B (second)
///
///   +------+------+--------------------------+------+------+---------------
///   | Next | Prev |   usable space           | Next | Prev | usable space..
///   +------+------+--------------------------+------+--+---+---------------
///   ^  |                                     ^         |
///   |  '-------------------------------------'         |
///   |                                                  |
///   '----------- Block B's prev points to Block A -----'
/// @endverbatim
///
/// One use for these blocks is ...
///
/// Each block also contains flags for ...
///
/// @verbatim embed:rst:leading-slashes
///  .-----------------------------------------------------------------------.
///  |                            Block                                      |
///  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
///  |              Next            | Prev |         usable space            |
///  +----------------+------+------+      +                                 |
///  |   Ptr[N..2]    | Last | Used |      |                                 |
///  +----------------+------+------+------+---------------------------------+
///  ^
///  |
///  '----------- Next() = Next & ~0x3 --------------------------------->
/// @endverbatim
///
/// The first block in a chain is ...
///
/// Note, This block class requires ...
///
/// This class must be ...
```

The third try is the charm, right?

<img src="/verbatim-wrangling-3.png"
     alt="The rendered page after the third attempt. Everything is completely
          messed up, again."/>

WRONG. In the words of the great Bender Bending Rodriguez: we're boned.

In an act of pure desperation, let's try ChatGPT (GPT-4). I asked:

```
I have a plaintext diagram. verbatim is not working for me. What should I do?
```

(This was part of a longstanding conversation about Doxygen.)

ChatGPT replied:

```
Doxygen has another command for preserving the preformatted text blocks:
@code{.unparsed} ... @endcode. This command will prevent Doxygen from parsing
the text inside the block and will preserve whitespace.
```

`@code{.unparsed}`, huh? Weird. Looks gross. But at this point I've got nothing
to lose. Let's try it:

```
/// The "Block" type is intended to ...
///
/// @code{.unparsed}
///   .------+---------------------------------.-----------------------------
///   |            Block A (first)             |       Block B (second)
///
///   +------+------+--------------------------+------+------+---------------
///   | Next | Prev |   usable space           | Next | Prev | usable space..
///   +------+------+--------------------------+------+--+---+---------------
///   ^  |                                     ^         |
///   |  '-------------------------------------'         |
///   |                                                  |
///   '----------- Block B's prev points to Block A -----'
/// @endcode
///
/// One use for these blocks is ...
///
/// Each block also contains flags for ...
///
/// @code{.unparsed}
///  .-----------------------------------------------------------------------.
///  |                            Block                                      |
///  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
///  |              Next            | Prev |         usable space            |
///  +----------------+------+------+      +                                 |
///  |   Ptr[N..2]    | Last | Used |      |                                 |
///  +----------------+------+------+------+---------------------------------+
///  ^
///  |
///  '----------- Next() = Next & ~0x3 --------------------------------->
/// @endcode
///
/// The first block in a chain is ...
///
/// Note, This block class requires ...
///
/// This class must be ...
```

Surely it won't work but we might as well check...

<img src="/verbatim-wrangling-4.png"
     alt="It worked! Everything is rendering correctly."/>

The LLMs strike again. It worked. This is why I keep telling my fellow technical
writers that we really need to wake up and realize that LLMs can be a very powerful
tool with the potential to offer a much faster and easier experience for our users.
I spent hours digging through the Doxygen and Breathe docs (and Google Search and
Stack Overflow) to find a solution, and nothing worked. The LLM showed me a working
solution that I had not encountered anywhere else on the first go.
