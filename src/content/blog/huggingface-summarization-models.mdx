  Can I use one of the summarization models published on HuggingFace to locally
  generate summaries for each page of my Sphinx site? The answer after one
  night of Covid-delirious experimentation appears to be a resounding "maybe"!

Summarization is attractive to me for a few reasons. By "attractive" I mean I
may actually try to ship page summarization on the docs sites I work on.

* It's actually useful. A lot of technical docs use Too. Many. Damn. Words.
  Summaries are very helpful for making quick [information
  scent](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/information-scent/) decisions.
* It can be architectified as a batch job. Generate the summary at build time and
  store it somewhere. You don't need to re-generate until the page content
  changes.

[HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) is
super cool. The API is really beginner-friendly and the docs site seems really
well done. It took me a comically long time to realize that I'm supposed to
mentally replace every instance of "ü§ó" in their docs with "HuggingFace" but
once I got past that <strike>hiccup</strike> hiccough I was cruising.

My other site, [biodigitaljazz.net], runs on [Sphinx]. I spun up a simple
[extension] to generate a summary for each page. First, let's look at an even
simpler extension that just spits out the text of a single page:

```py
import docutils

def show_me_the_text(app, doctree, docname):
    if docname != 'blog/picam':
        return
    text = doctree.astext()
    print(text)

def setup(app):
    app.connect('doctree-resolved', show_me_the_text)
    return {
        'parallel_read_safe': True,
        'parallel_write_safe': True,
    }
```

There are some setup steps I'm skipping but after it's all rigged up the
following text gets printed out:

```
The eleventh circle of hell: setting up an RPi camera module

2023 Nov 22

Short story long, don‚Äôt trust any of the community content; it‚Äôs full of ghosts
and wolverines and those people you meet at parties that start the
conversation with ‚Äúso what do you do?‚Äù‚Ä¶ Rely solely on the official RPi
docs. And make sure that whatever you‚Äôre reading was written for the
specific HW/SW permutation that you‚Äôre using. In my case (RPi4 + RPi OS
Bookworm + RPi Camera Module 3) the correct doc is The Picamera2 Library.

Once I found the right doc it was trivial to get everything working. The
picamera2 repo has an extensive collection of examples. It‚Äôs downright magical
that I can get started with computer vision in a matter of minutes. OpenCV is
really cool stuff.

This gem of a quote from an RPi engineer sums up the situation:

Hi, yes it‚Äôs a bit of a minefield out there on the web because so much
content is still referring to the legacy camera stack which will never
(for example) support the camera module 3, or even work at all on any
reasonably modern Raspberry Pi OS image.

I‚Äôm not writing this post to complain; who has time for that? This is just
a courtesy heads up to my fellow hackers.

<p style="margin-top: 10000px;">
    Huh? You're still here? And you scrolled all the way down here just
    to ask "What's the tenth circle?" Excellent question. I have no idea.
</p>
```

This is the exact text that the models will see.

Now let's rig up this bad <strike>boy</strike> extension to do some
summarization!

```py
import docutils
import transformers

models = [
    'facebook/bart-large-cnn',
    'sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6',
    'philschmid/bart-large-cnn-samsum',
    'pszemraj/led-base-book-summary',
    'google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail',
    'google/pegasus-xsum',
    'Falconsai/medical_summarization',
    'google/bigbird-pegasus-large-arxiv',
    'knkarthick/MEETING_SUMMARY',
    'pszemraj/led-large-book-summary',
    'google/pegasus-large',
    'knkarthick/MEETING-SUMMARY-BART-LARGE-XSUM-SAMSUM-DIALOGSUM-AMI',
    'facebook/bart-large-xsum',
    'csebuetnlp/mT5_multilingual_XLSum',
    'ArtifactAI/led_large_16384_arxiv_summarization'
]

def summarize(app, doctree, docname):
    if docname != 'blog/picam':
        return
    text = doctree.astext()
    for model in models:
        print(f'\n\n\n********** {model} **********\n\n')
        try:
            summarizer = transformers.pipeline('summarization', model=model)
            result = summarizer(text)
            print(result[0]['summary_text'])
        except Exception as e:
            print('error')

def setup(app):
    app.connect('doctree-resolved', summarize)
    return {
        'parallel_read_safe': True,
        'parallel_write_safe': True,
    }
```

I pulled that list of models from the [most downloaded models that support
the summarization pipeline](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=summarization&sort=downloads).

And now the results!

```

Holy shit, talk about a terrible start. I have no idea what `scathing„Ç∞`
means but I definitely feel threatened by it. Let's just put that one in
[the vault] and keep going...

(Of course, the real answer is that I'm just holding something wrong or the
model isn't actually intended for this task. Never underestimate pilot error.)

The eleventh circle of hell: setting up an RPi camera module In this chapter,
the author explains how to get everything working without relying on any of
the official RPi docs. He uses OpenCV and OpenCV to get things running. This is
just a courtesy post to his fellow hackers.
```

OK! 4 models in and we've got something almost usable. The formatting is off
though and there's actually a huge factual error. It says I got everything
working without relying on any of the official docs. That is categorically *not*
what I say in the post.

(A lot of the models error'd. I think that's just because I'm running these
tests via `transformers[tf-cpu]` on a Linux.)

Onwards! [No prisoners! No prisoners!]

A lot of these things seem to just be verbatim regurgitations of my original
text, with worse formatting. `Bookworm + RPi OS = nightmare` has a nice ring
to it, though...

This is a variant of the other model that worked well. This text is a little
better than that previous model.

I‚Äôm a big fan of OpenCV, but I‚Äôve found that if you want to get started with

What stands out to me most is how *different* this text is than the other
models. It's sending a negative message about OpenCV that doesn't exist in the
source text, though.

[Well, that about does 'er. Wraps 'er all up.](https://youtu.be/sYsw0KVRjCM?si=Hvpt8aYhc2XyC7FO&t=73)
I'll get those errors fixed and keep exploring other models. I'll also try
more sophisticated model invocations, such as the example from
[csebuetnlp/mT5_multilingual_XLSum].

Assuming that I can find a model that works, the next hurdle is the size of
the dependencies. The `transformers[tf-cpu]` library that I used appears to be
hundreds of megabytes. The model is usually another gigabyte at least. And
of course there's all the licensing uncertainty around generated content. I also
imagine that these models can't handle that much text. I guess I could do a 
divide-and-conquer approach where I generate a summary for each section,
concatenate all those summaries together, and then run the summarization one
last time on the concatenated section-level summaries. Sphinx makes it trivial
to process a doc section-by-section. Sphinx rules.

P.S. the next time you find yourself battling an evil wizard, remember the auric defense
