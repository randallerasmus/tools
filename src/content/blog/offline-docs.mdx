[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) (HN) is a forum for technology news.
A lot of software engineers visit and discuss stuff on HN. There's a
[thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36135955) on the "front page"
of HN right now about [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org), "an offline documentation
browser for software developers." It's basically a desktop app that lets you
pick and choose documentation sets to download. The doc sets get saved to disk
and you can read the docs offline through the Zeal browser.

This is [the most upvoted comment in the thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36137032):

I.e. offline docs systems are great but they need better search interfaces.

Similar products:

* [devdocs.io](https://devdocs.io)
* [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash)

I personally have felt the need for offline docs on quite a few occasions. Flying on an
airplane is the most common use case. But sometimes I just want to go to a coffee shop
and work on one of my little toy projects without needing to connect to the shop's
Wi-Fi. Or the Wi-Fi in my house is acting spotty for whatever reason. And so on.

Another [comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36140344) from the same thread:

I.e. offline docs systems need all versions of the doc sets.

This [comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36137521) kicked off a discussion on why
people like and use offline docs systems:

* Google Search isn't surfacing the official docs as the top result any more
* One person intentionally goes offline to remove distractions
* Very fast lookups
